              <h3>I Brought You My Bullets,<br>You Brought Me Your Love</h3>
              <p class="greytxt">After Gerard Way, the frontman, witnessed the World Trade Center towers fall, he decided 
                to start a band. Way wrote the song "Skylines and Turnstiles" to express his feelings about
                September 11. The first recording sessions were undertaken in an attic, the band refers to 
                those sessions as "The Attic Demos." They recorded their debut album, <strong>I Brought You My 
                Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love</strong>, just three months after the formation of the band. It was
                produced by a friend who was the frontman of another band and they released it in 2002 through 
                Eyeball Records.

              <h3>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</h3>
              <p class="greytxt">In 2003, the band signed a deal with Reprise Records, a major label. A year later, 
                they released <strong>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</strong>. They released four singles 
                from the album "<em>I'm Not Okay (I Promise)</em>", "<em>Thank You for the Venom</em>", "<em>Helena</em>", and "<em>The 
                Ghost of You</em>". The album went platinum in just over a year of its release. One of the 
                major influences for this album was the passing of Gerard and Mikey Way's grandmother, with
                the song Helena named after her.

              <h3>The Black Parade</h3>
              <p class="greytxt">In 2006, the band played a special one-off show at the London Hammersmith Palais. Actors 
                walked around the venue with capes and signs of "The Black Parade", it was announced that 
                MCR were unable to play, but they would be replaced by The Black Parade. The band performed 
                under a pseudonym for the theme of the album and continued wearing the costumes seen in the 
                album's music videos. Welcome to the Black Parade became the band's first UK number one and the 
                album ranked as one of the top albums of the year multiple times. In 2007, MCR won the NME Best 
                International Band award.

              <h3>Danger Days:<br>The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</h3>
              <p class="greytxt">Their much anticipated fourth studio album, reffered to as <strong>Danger Days</strong>,
                was released in 2010, and is their final album release before their almost 7-year breakup. 
                This album follows a story: within a post-apocalyptic California, in the then future 2019, 
                the band pose as outsiders called 'Killjoys' to fight against the ruling evil corporation. 
                In 2013, frontman Gerard Way published a comic that continues the story described in the 
                album. The album received generally favourable reviews, scoring 70/100 from Metacritic, and 
                being #28 on Rolling Stone's 30 Best Albums of 2010.
